# MCAP - Summer Institute (Model Specification and Causal Analysis)

This repository contains R code and prepared data files for the module on model specification and causal analysis for the MCAP Summer Institute workshop on longitudinal analysis. This includes the following files:

1. mcapsi-model-specification-data.R: R code that prepares the following three analytic samples for examples. Note that this code extracts data from the RAND HRS longitudinal file -- the 1992-2022 v1 release. Users will need to update the path to the data.

2. mcapsi-model-specification-long-hrs.csv: CSV file with data prepared for examples of fixed effects models.

3. mcapsi-model-specification-wide-hrs.csv: CSV file with data prepared for examples of latent growth models.

4. mcapsi-model-specification-wide-2-hrs.csv: CSV file with data prepared for examples of dynamic models in a SEM framework.

5. mcapsi-model-specification-examples.R: R code that reproduces the examples illustrated in the slides for the module.
